            <h2>Network Security</h2>
            <p>Network security secures computer networks and infrastructure such as, firewalls,
            switches, routers etc. Network security aims<br>to implement cryptography's role of 
            providing confidentiality and integrity, as well as authentification however, this is another<br>
            subsection of computer and cyber security (G.A. Martin, 2005).<br>
            </p>
            <p>Firewalls are a shield that seperates internal and external networks which is used
            to filter traffic by using a computers filters<br>or security rules to allow data in or out.
            <br><br>
            Network security uses Intrusion Detection and Prevention systems (IDPS), which monitors
            networks data stream to find and stop any threats.<br>Such as, intrusion attempts, malware or
            malicious activities and unauthorized access.
            <br><br>
            Network segmenation is a critical part of building a secure network (Neerja Mhaskar, 2021).
            Segmentations seperates data of diferent security<br>levels which are then protected by firewalls
            which follow appropriate rules. Network segmentation is a vital part of dthe design of netwroks.<br>
            Segmentation limits the likelyhood of a security breach massively.
            <br><br>
            Virual Private Networks (VPN) allows users to establish a secure remote access to networks over the internet.
            It also ensures encrypted connections<br>and confidentiality of transmitted data. VPN's help
            firewalls to encrypt and decrypt data in speciic network data streams<br>between the internal and external
            networks (Karen Scarfone, 2009).
