                <p>Data security involves protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access, leakage,
                loss prevention and data misuse. It usees:
                <br>
                - Data Encryption
                <br> - User Access Controls
                <br> - Data Classification
                <br> - Data Loss prevention
                <br> - Security Poloicies and Procedures    
                </p>
                <p>Data encyption is where data is encoded to be unreadable to those who arent authorized
                It uses cryptographoc algorithms to convert data,<br>encyrption techniques such as hashing
                are also used, which are usually found when storing passwords. Encyption has been used for thousands<br>
                of years to store data, the most famous encryption method is the Caesar Cipher. Encryption is
                the most common method of securing data<br> and can range from how secure they are.<br><br>
                Data loss prevention (DLP), prevent the possibility of data breaches by monitoring streams of 
                sensitive data. The solutions can detect and block<br>unauthorized transfers of data.
